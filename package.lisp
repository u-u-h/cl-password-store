   "Password management for Common Lisp (web) applications.

`cl-password-store` provides a light-weight and extendible solution to
user/password management:

* safe password storage:
    + cleartext-free, using your choice of hash algorithm through
      [ironclad](http://method-combination.net/lisp/ironclad/),
    + storage in an SQL database through
      [clsql](http://clsql.b9.com/), in a database your application
      already uses anyway, or in a separate one, and using any backend
      supported by clsql,
* password reset mechanism with one-time tokens (suitable for mailing
  to users for confirmation),
* user creation optionally with confirmation tokens (suitable for
  mailing to users),
* (obviously) user authentication.

Users can be identified by strings or by subclassing
[`user-token-mixin`](class-user--token--mixin.html).
