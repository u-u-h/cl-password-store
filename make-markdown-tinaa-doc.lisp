;; Commentary:
;; 

;; This is a gross hack but largely works (except that I did not bother
;; to fix the :before method on maybe-show-documentation that 
;; switches internal/external symbols on and off. TINAA also seems
;; to incorrectly handle slots and accessors of conditions.
;;
;; Load this in a lisp session to regenerate documentation under #p"doc/"
